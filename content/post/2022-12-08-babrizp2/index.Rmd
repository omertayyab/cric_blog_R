# Introduction
At the end of part 1, we had come to the conclusion that our under-fire pair of openers was in fact an impactful combination, but we had not figured out whether their playing style and strategy was the best use of the team's resources. To do that, we realized that we'd have to devise a method to measure the the trade-off between Strike Rate and average.

Building a measure for that trade-off is a little tricky. This is because the trade-off is sensitive to several factors. One example of a factor is the context of the match. Consider the following examples:
1. A team needs 20 runs to win off 10 balls
2. A team needs 100 runs of 80 balls 

In these specifically chosen examples, we can easily observe: 
  1. a high SR is desirable in the first case, because the required runs are low and we have less balls remaining to score those runs
  2. For the second example, we'd want better consistency and players with higher averages to increase chances of victory.
  
And match context is just one factor, there could be several other factors like:
  1. Capability and role of other batters
  2. Pitch and overhead conditions
  3. quality of opposition's bowling
  4. Batting first or second

All this is to say that creating a measure that can encompass all these factors would require the kind of data we may not have. Instead, what we can do is look at th
