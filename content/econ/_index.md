Title: "Economics"

---
Hello, welcome to the Economics section. This is the more serious section of the website where I'll try to tackle currently relevant questions related to the global economy. I'll (most likely) not be including code snippets in the posts here, as the purpose is commentary on Economics, but the R Markdown files will be available on my Github for anyone looking to reproduce the results.
